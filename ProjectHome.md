Basic icecast server for handling multiple mp3-streams. It's written in pure Java and works on all platforms. The only external library that is used is jAudioTagger for extracting id3-tags from the media.

This was more of a proof of concept than a real project, if there are people interested in using/developing an icecast server in java i could start up the project again. If so, please send me an email.

See the [project news page](http://code.google.com/p/locality-icecast/wiki/News) for more information.
